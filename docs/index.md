# Welcome to the Reanalysis of Data User Interface for MS2 (ReDU-MS2)

ReDU-MS2 is a web-based user interface that can be used to easily **Analyze Your Data** or **Analyze All Public Data**. The user interface allows one to select public mass spectrometry files in MassIVE (massive.ucsd.edu), a public mass spectrometry data repository, based on a curated set of sample information and launch reanalyses in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform, gnps.ucsd.edu. 

MS2 data (aka tandem mass spectrometry, MS<sup>2</sup>, MS/MS), specifically product ion scans, are obtained from user-submitted open-source data files (.mzXML) and analyzed *de novo* using molecular networking and chemical annotations within GNPS.

This is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to submit their own data (instructions [here]).

We are developing two main branches of functionality:

* **Analyze Your Data**
  * Multivariate Comparison of Your MS2 Annotations with Public Data
  * Co-Analyze your Data via GNPS Molecular Networking
  * Sample Information Enrichment Analysis

* **Analyze All Public Data**
  * Multivariate Analysis of MS2 Annotations
  * Reanalyze Public Data via GNPS Molecular Networking
  * Chemical Annotation Enrichment Analysis
  * Sample Information Enrichment Analysis
