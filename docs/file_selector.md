!!! example "Tutorial"
	1. Select the files you wish to include in the re-analysis by clicking the desired group button (*i.e.* G1-G6).
		- The orange buttons in the center of the screen correspond to Sample Information categories.
		- If filter/s are used, they will appear as red box/boxes in the Attribute Filters Panel (upper-right corner) of the page. To remove already selected filters click on the red boxed filter you wish to remove and the item should disappear from Attribute Filters Panel.
		- When files are selected into a group the corresponding button becomes red and the number of files is updated in the Selection Summary Panel (upper-left corner).
