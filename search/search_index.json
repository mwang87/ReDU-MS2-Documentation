Please click the \"convert spectra\" button to expedite inclusion in ReDU. Step 2 - Sample Information 2A - Make a copy of the Sample Information Template Navigate to the ReDU Sample Information Template One template is required per MassIVE ID. Save a copy of the sample information template by going to \"File - Make a copy\" into a personal google drive 2B - Fill the Sample Information Template Fill in sample information using drop-downs when applicable (grey columns at the end of the template are automatically entered using formulae). It is highly recommended to fill the template in Google Sheets to ensure validation. When copying and pasting from another spreadsheet, please copy + special paste so as to not chance the cell formulae or formatting. ReDU uses a controlled vocublary - the accepted terms are listed in the \"ReDUMS2_controlled_vocabulary\" tab per column. If you require terms that are not avaliable, please raise an issue on GitHub . 2C - Download the Sample Information Template When complete, delete all extra rows of the template. Download from Google Sheets as a tab separated text file using \"File-Download as\" and selecting \"Tab-seperated values...\" Step 3 - Validation 3A - Validate your Sample Information File Navigate to the ReDU Sample Information Validator Drag-and-drop or select your sample information file into the validator. A message will indicate if the files passes or not. Non-adherant information is displayed in the \"Sample Information Validation Errors\" panel - the row, column, and the accepted terms are listed. If errors occur, then please correct the non-adherant information in the template and repeat from 2C 3B - Rename the Sample Information File Upon passing the validator, rename the file to be exactly \"gnps_metadata.tsv\" The filename must be gnps_metadata.tsv - this step is critical It is suggested to make a seperate directory on your computer to store each MassIVE IDs sample information template Step 4 - Upload the validated Sample Information file named \"gnps_metadata.tsv\" Navigate to the MassIVE ID created Click on the \"add files\" button Use the Drag-and-Drop upload option to add the validated sample information file named \"gnps_metadata.tsv\" Place the validated sample information file into the \"Supplementary file\" folder and submit the update That is it! Double check that your data make it into the ReDU file selector .

Files across data sets from the same sample type can be selected easily. One can find an annotation of interest and see the chemicals related to it. For example, if one was interested in the metabolism of drug A, and drug A is known to be in blood samples. One could select blood, urine, and fecal samples to see if metabolites of drug A exist in the public data. Summary Molecular Networking is performed in GNPS . Users can re-analyze public data by selecting files using the ReDU file selector. The file selector allows one to select (and filter) files based on the sample information provided with every file, and place multiple types of files into one of 6 different groups ( i.e. G1-G6). A single button click on \"Set Up Re-Analysis with GNPS Networking\" loads all the files and begins a GNPS molecular job. Further documentation on GNPS molecular networking is located here . Tutorial Log into a GNPS account. Navigate to the ReDU homepage. Click on the \"Re-analyze Public Data at GNPS\" text. Select the files you wish to include in the re-analysis by clicking the desired group button ( i.e. G1-G6). The orange buttons in the center of the screen correspond to Sample Information categories. If filter/s are used, they will appear as red box/boxes in the Attribute Filters Panel (upper-right corner) of the page. To remove already selected filters click on the red boxed filter you wish to remove and the item should disappear from Attribute Filters Panel. When files are selected into a group the corresponding button becomes red and the number of files is updated in the Selection Summary Panel (upper-left corner). Click on the Set Up Re-Analysis with GNPS Networking button (blue) at the bottom of the page. Launch the molecular networking job with default parameters or customize parameters. Further documentation on GNPS molecular networking is located here . ### Notes * You must have an account at GNPS and be signed in prior to launching a job. * The number of groups is currently limited to 6. * The suggested limit for molecular networking is a total of 3000 files . Library Search at GNPS Example Use Cases Annotate chemicals in the public data via spectral library matching using custom parameters. Used for generating a list of annotations based on custom parameters for the files included. All files must be in G1. Summary A GNPS library search has been performed for all files with sample information in GNPS using default parameters ( found here ). This option allows users to reanalyze the public data via custom library search parameters. The library search results are displayed on GNPS which includes the option of downloading a table with every chemical annotation versus the files it was detected in (cells of the matrix reflect detected, 1, or not detected, 0). Further documentation on GNPS library search is located here . Tutorial Log into a GNPS account. Navigate to the ReDU homepage. Click on the \"Re-analyze Public Data at GNPS\" text.

Chemical Enrichment Analysis Example Use Cases Explore which chemicals have been detected in a subset of the public data in order to test or develop hypotheses, and determine the specific files in the public data that are relevant for follow up analysis. viz. I'm interested in the chemical differences between human urine and human blood - what are they? Summary All chemical annotations that originate from the selected public data are tabulated by group (G1-G6). Chemical annotation is performed in GNPS by comparing MS2 spectra, specifically product ion spectra, with reference MS2 fragmentation patterns (GNPS integrates of the majority of public reference MS2 spectra library). Default library search parameters are used. Tutorial Navigate to the ReDU homepage. Click on the \"Re-analyze Public Data at GNPS\" text.
